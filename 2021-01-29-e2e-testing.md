# Background

As we get closer to the release of _redacted-app-name_ it’s becoming increasingly important to ensure we don’t create any new regressions in the app when merging new features.

Even though we have high unit test coverage we’ve had a few incidents where a few code merges have broke some features. This created a good opportunity for us to investigate E2E testing for the app. Something that is notoriously scarce in the React Native world.

Implementing E2E testing for critical flows will allow us to be more confident when merging code. This will allow us to ship features faster and reduce QA cycles.

# E2E Testing Landscape

E2E testing in React Native apps is challenging because your app is not quite a React App nor it is a fully native app. Essentially it's a React JavaScript app, a Native iOS app and a Native Android app.

There are two main solutions in the React Native E2E testing space, Appium and Detox.

Both solutions are similar but Appium takes a “Black Box” approach whereas Detox takes a “Grey Box” approach. This means that Appium has no idea of the code being executed when running the test. This gives a testing experience similar to a legacy Selenium solution in JavaScript apps. This style of test tends to be rather flakey.

With Detox’s “Grey Box” approach the testing runtime partially knows about the code being run so it's able to make the test suites asynchronous.

In practice, this means not having to use lots of `wait(5000)` functions all over your tests hoping that things will execute in time. (Although sometimes you will have to manually add a wait and Detox does support this)

# Results

We decided to go with Detox primarily because of its Grey Box approach. Hoping to prevent flakiness in our tests.
However, even with Detox, it's not completely perfect. Setup was rather complicated with lots of native code changes on Android required. The documentation leaves a bit to be desired and we’re still noticing the occasional bit of flakiness even with Detox.

Overall as we learn more about E2E testing we should continue to improve the stability of this environment as much as possible.

# Considered Alternatives

- Appium:
  Appium is another popular and older solution. If we hit a dead end with Detox it could be worth considering spending more time investigating using Appium instead.
- Cypress:
  Cypress is the defacto modern e2e testing solution for React applications. It provides a great testing experience with very reliable test execution.

However, Cypress doesn’t support running e2e tests on iOS or Android devices. A common approach for using Cypress with React Native is to use “react-native-web” which boots up a React Native app in a browser and allows you to run tests against it.

I briefly attempted this approach but ran into cryptic `expo` errors and decided to invest my time into Detox instead.

If we were to solve the expo errors Cypress would provide the best testing experience (and remove the need for running iOS VMs in CI). However, it wouldn’t catch the rare occasion we have cross-platform issues on Android & iOS. (Although I believe those would be few and far between)
