Approved

## Context

As we start to build our new React Native app we need to decide whether to build our app using vanilla React Native or the popular React Native framework [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/expo/).

## Background

Expo has been around for a while. It allows you to build React Native apps but abstracts away most of the native Android and iOS code and write pure JavaScript 99% of the time.
Expo allows you to easily test and share apps without having to deploy to TestFlight or using AndroidStudio or Xcode. Expo also provides a Sass product called Expo Application Services (EAS)
that significantly streamlines building and deploying React Native apps to the app store.

Previously Expo had large native binary sizes and didn't support custom native code without "ejecting". These issues went away in December 2021 when they released EAS Build which supports any React Native app. The concept of "ejecting" was replaced by the Expo Prebuild feature which has been around since SDK 41 (April 2021). The expo eject command was fully deprecated in Expo SDK 46 (August 2022).

## Expo Pros

- Better development experience
- Better QA and Deployment workflow
- Don't need to write any native mobile code
- Much easier to do OTA updates

## Expo Cons

The full list of expo drawbacks can be seen [here](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/why-not-expo/)
The main thing is some native APIs aren't available however you can work around this using EAS Build.
We've evaluated the items on this list and felt it wasn't a major concern for us.

## Decision

Use Expo for the Heir React Native App
